```perl
  # Which makes the S->{ext_wsl} field available,
  # pointing at the default session, in steps of features or scenarios
  # marked with the '@weasel' tag so in the steps you can use:

  use Weasel::FindExpanders::HTML;

  Then qr/I see an input element with label XYZ/, sub {
    S->{ext_wsl}->page->find('*labelled', text => 'XYZ');
  };
```
# DESCRIPTION

This module implements an extension to [Test::BDD::Cucumber
(aka pherkin)](https://github.com/pjlsergeant/test-bdd-cucumber-perl),
providing access to a
[`Weasel::Session`](https://github.com/perl-weasel/weasel/) and the
following features:

  * Starting sessions for scenarios which need it
  * Taking screenshots on configured events
  * Provide basic steps for
    * Page navigation
    * Page content assertion

Intended features to be implemented:

  * Browser session transcript recording, annotating browser
    manipulation invocations with Weasel function return
    values and screenshots.

(More ideas welcome, please log issues.)
